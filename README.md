# Uzhunnu Vada
  Uzhunnu Vada, also known as Medu Vada or Urad dal fritters, is a common snack
in South India. It is not only popular as a snack but also as a part of a yummy 
breakfast along with Idli, Sambar and Chutney. Uzhunnu Vada is really an 
aromatic and a mouth-watering snack. The plain deep fried lentils add to the 
flavour; besides, the addition of ginger, pearl onions and curry leaves imparts 
a fantastic aroma that is tempting. You can find this Uzhunnu Vada in most tea 
stalls and restaurants all over South India. 
   I bet you that you can never stop with one piece.
