# Recipe
   1) Wash black gram, soak in water for 30 minutes and drain it.
   
   2) Grind it into a smooth paste by sprinkling a little water if required.
      The batter should be thick as possible.

   3) Chop ginger, green chillies, shallots and curry leaves finely.

   4) Add the chopped ingredients, crushed black pepper, rice flour and salt to 
      the ground paste. Combine well and keep aside for 10 minutes.

   5) Pour enough oil into a deep bottom pan and heat it. When the oil is hot 
      reduce the flame to medium.

   6) Dip your hands in water (to prevent sticking batter on your hand) and take
      a small portion of the uzhunnu vada mix on your palm. Shape it to round
      and make a hole in the center using your finger. Slip it slowly into the
      hot oil and deep fry by turning both sides till golden brown color.

   7) Repeat the previous step to make more uzhunnu vada.

   8) Serve it with hot.
